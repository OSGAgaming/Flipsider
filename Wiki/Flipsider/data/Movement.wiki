++ Movement

Player is inherently fast, but doesn't recieve any speed upgrades.
Sprinting is default.
Crouch with shift, slide by crouching while running.
Wall jumping and wall sliding exists, as well as grappling up ledges.
Fall damage exists, but can be circumvented by pressing shift as the player hits the ground to roll. Perfectly rolling completely negates fall damage. Otherwise, player takes damage and a breif stun.
